# Kernel-SVM-in-R
This ML model is used for classifications when non linear data is given. It uses a kernel function to determine the classifier by mapping it to a higher degree and then again projecting it to 2D.
SVM algorithms use a set of mathematical functions that are defined as the kernel. The function of kernel is to take data as input and transform it into the required form. ... For example linear, nonlinear, polynomial, radial basis function (RBF), and sigmoid
